### Description
    THIS IS A TEST BETA FOR IDENTIFYING BUGS, EXPECT BUGS!

    ** NIGHT CITY JUST GOT A LITTLE MORE DANGEROUS. **

    Adds cyberpsychos who wreck havoc on Night City to Cyberpunk 2077's open world.

    **ANYTIME, ANYWHERE**

    Attacks can occur anywhere. Depending on the district, help may be seconds or minutes away. But in Pacifica and the North Industrial District, cyberpsychos cause chaos outside the bounds of the NCPD and MaxTac.

    ** "IF THEY CALL MAXTAC, THEY'RE ALL SCREWED." **

    Watch Night City's apex predators in action.
